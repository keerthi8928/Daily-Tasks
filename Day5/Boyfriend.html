    <p><b>Lyrics</b><br> 
        I want a boyfriend<br>
But I just keep hitting dead ends<br>
Try to take a shortcut<br>
But I get cut again and again<br>
I want a boyfriend<br><br>

Tell me, are there any good ones left?<br>
I keep finding wrong ones<br>
But I want love again and again<br>
I want a boyfriend<br><br>

I been up all night<br>
Pretty restlessly<br>
Think I might know why (Ah)<br>
I've been doing just fine<br>
But baby, that don't mean<br>
That I'm feeling anti you and me<br><br>

There's a difference between a want and a need<br>
Some nights, I just want more than me<br>
I know that there's a fine line between<br>
It's not what I need, but (Yeah)<br><br>

I want a boyfriend<br>
But I just keep hitting dead ends<br>
Try to take a shortcut<br>
But I get cut again and again (Yeah)<br>
I want a boyfriend (Uh-huh)<br>
Tell me, are there any good ones left?<br>
I keep finding wrong ones<br>
But I want love again and again (Yeah)<br>
I want a boyfriend<br>

I want a boyfriend<br>

I could phone a friend<br>
Use a hotline or something<br>
But that won't get the job done (Uh-uh)<br>
'Cause every time I try (Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Every time they lie (Uh, ooh-hoo)<br>
I get a little anti you and me<br><br>

There's a difference between a want and a need<br>
Some nights, I just want more than me<br>
I know that there's a fine line between<br>
It's not what I need, but (Ooh-hoo)<br><br>

I want a boyfriend<br>
But I just keep hitting dead ends<br>
Try to take a shortcut<br>
But I get cut again and again (Yeah, ooh)<br>
I want a boyfriend (Uh-huh)<br>
Tell me, are there any good ones left?<br>
I keep finding wrong ones<br>
But I want love again and again (Ha-ha-ha-ha)<br><br>

I want a boyfriend (Ah, ayy, yeah)<br>
I want a boyfriend (Ah, I try to)<br>
I want a (Ah, yeah)<br>
I want a boyfriend (Ah, yeah)<br>
I want a<br>
