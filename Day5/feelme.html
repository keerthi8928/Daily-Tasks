    <p><b>Lyrics</b><br>
        No one love you like I love ya<br>
        Never cheat, never lie<br>
        Never put no one above ya<br>
        I gave you space and time<br>
        And now you're telling me you miss it<br>
        And I'm still on your mind<br>
        We were one in a million<br>
        And love is hard to find<br>
        Do you stay up late, just so you don't dream?<br>
        Every time your lips touch another<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        Every time you dance with somebody<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        Do your days get a little bit longer?<br>
        Nights get a little bit colder?<br>
        Heartbeat a little bit louder?<br>
        Hah ah ah ah oh (do you feel me?)<br>
        Days get a little bit longer? (Feel me)<br>
        Nights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)<br>
        Heartbeat a little bit louder?<br>
        Hah ah ah ah oh<br>
        When you're running, who you run to?<br>
        Where do you go to hide?<br>
        When she ain't giving you enough to get you through the night<br>
        Won't be caught up in the middle<br>
        Of your highs and your lows<br>
        Baby, 'long as you're not with me, you'll always be alone<br>
        Do you stay up late, just so you don't dream?<br>
        Every time your lips touch another<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        Every time you dance with somebody<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        Do your days get a little bit longer?<br>
        Nights get a little bit colder?<br>
        Heartbeat a little bit louder?<br>
        Hah ah ah ah oh (do you feel me?)<br>
        Days get a little bit longer? (Feel me)<br>
        Nights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)<br>
        Heartbeat a little bit louder?<br>
        Hah ah ah ah oh<br>
        Feel me (feel me)<br>
        Feel me (feel me)<br>
        Feel me (feel me)<br>
        Every time your lips touch another<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        Every time you dance with somebody<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        I want you to feel me<br>
        Do your days get a little bit longer?<br>
        Nights get a little bit colder?<br>
        Heartbeat a little bit louder?<br>
        Hah ah ah ah oh (do you feel me?)<br>
        Days get a little bit longer? (Feel me)<br>
        Nights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)<br>
        Heartbeat a little bit louder?<br>
        Hah ah ah ah oh<br>
        Every time your lips touch another<br>
        Hah ah ah ah oh<br>
        Every time you dance with somebody</p>
