    <p><b>Lyrics</b><br>
        It's crazy when<br>
The thing you love the most is the detriment<br>
Let that sink in<br>
You can think again<br>
When the hand you wanna hold is a weapon and<br>
You're nothin' but skin<br><br>

Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper<br>
I won't stop 'til I get where you are<br>
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running<br><br>

They say I may be making a mistake<br>
I would've followed all the way, no matter how far<br>
I know when you go down all your darkest roads<br>
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard<br><br>

Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper<br>
I won't stop 'til I get where you are<br>
I keep running when both my feet hurt<br>
I won't stop 'til I get where you are<br>
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads<br>
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard (no, oh)<br><br>

You look at me (look at me)<br>
With eyes so dark, don't know how you even see<br>
You push right through me (push right through me)<br>
It's gettin' real<br>
You lock the door, you're drunk at the steering wheel<br>
And I can't conceal<br><br>

Oh, 'cause I've been diggin' myself down deeper<br>
I won't stop 'til I get where you are<br>
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running<br><br>

They say I may be making a mistake<br>
I would've followed all the way, no matter how far<br>
I know when you go down all your darkest roads<br>
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard<br><br>

Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper<br>
I won't stop 'til I get where you are<br>
I keep running when both my feet hurt<br>
I won't stop 'til I get where you are<br>
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads<br>
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard<br><br>

Oh, it's funny how<br>
The warning signs can feel like they're butterflies<br><br>

Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper<br>
I won't stop 'til I get where you are<br>
I keep running when both my feet hurt<br>
I won't stop 'til I get where you are<br>
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads<br>
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard<br><br>
